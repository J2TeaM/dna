/*
Package dna implements some basic functionalities of functional programming styles

For the most part, it focuses on redefining some of basic parts:
	* Rewriting the most popular types: Int, String, Bool... into objects
	* Adding methods to each types.
	* Rewriting the StringArray(array of string) and IntArray(array of int)
	* Adding methods to each array type
	* Adding Log method to print on screen
	* Adding some utils: ParseInt(),Map()...

Notice: The Object-like primitive types have some methods that do not check the input. Error maybe occurs in runtime. Therefore check the input while coding
